There are n network nodes labelled 1 to N.
Given a times array, containing edges represented by arrays [u, v, w] where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time taken to travel from the source node to the target node.
w can be -ve.
Send a signal from node k, return how long it takes for all nodes to receive the signal. Return -1 if it's impossible.
