On a given nxn chessboard, a knight piece will start at the r-th row and c-th column. The knight will attempt to make k moves.

A knight can move in 8 possible ways. Each move will choose one of these 8 at random. The knight continues moving until it finishes k moves, or it moves off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight is on the chessboard after it finishes moving.
