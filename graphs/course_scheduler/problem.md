There are a total of n courses to take, labeled from 0 to n-l. 
Some courses have prerequisites (courses). This is expressed as a pair i.e. [1,0] which indicates you must take course 0 before taking course 1.

Given the total number of courses and an array of prerequisite pairs, return if it is possible to finish all courses.
