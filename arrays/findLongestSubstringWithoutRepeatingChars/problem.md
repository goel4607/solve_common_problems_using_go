Given a string, find the length of longest sub-string without repeating characters.

"abcabb"

Here abc and cab are two strings of same length so longest substring is 3

Constraints:
- when two strings have same length the return any
- null or blank string length is zero
- is the string contiguous? Yes (substring)
- Does case sensitivity matter? No (all chars are lowercase)
