Given an unsorted array, return the kth largest element. It is the kth largest element in sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example: 1
Input: [5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2] and k = 2,
Suppose the sorted array is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] so the return value would be 5

Example: 2
Input: [2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2] and k = 4,
Suppose the sorted array is: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4] here if it would be asking for 4th largest distinct number then we would
be returning 1 but since we are asking for non-distinct number, so the expected answer would be 2 (instead-of 1)
